A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing by fleexing the muscles at the sides of the mouth. It is <br>believed it takes about 80 muscles to smile. Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the corner of the eyes, <br> an action known as a "Duchenne smile". Smiles per formed without the eye contraction may be perceived as insincere.</B></p>
